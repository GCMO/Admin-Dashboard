# ADMIN-DASHBOARD #1

OVERVIEW:

React Native advanced difficulty project. Complex SideBar (minimized via hamburged button) with Ecommerce Pages, Charts, TextEditor, ColorPicker, KanBan & Calendar. UserProfile, Chats, Notification & Cart are in popup form. Finally the ToolIcon provides a theme selector that allows for a Light/Dark Theme and change of color for buttons and some other elements in the ECommerce page.

STACK:

React, React-Context, Tailwind, SyncFusion. All data is fake and connected to Data/dummy.jsx .  However most of this data is setup dynamically to simplify connection with server & db.

OBJECTIVE:

To develop a fully customizable and very interactive ECommerce Dashboard ready to use in any project. Next, I would like to create a Crypto Dashboard 

LEARNING CURVE:

This project has been on my TodoList for months. I finally got around to do it, using TAILWIND despite my resistance to inline CSS (I still hate it, but I can see the power of Tailwind abreviated commands, as well as not having to switch around to the CSS files all the time and/or having to find each class or ID). Overall I must admit Tailwind is quite efficient and a time saver, so eventually this resistance will dissipate. Also used all of SYNCFUSION free access features: another stip and frustrating learning curve, but they have great documentation and tutorials. I love their Charts and will likely use this library again in the future. 

DEPLOYMENT:

Deployed on VERCEL. First time using this platform, extremely smooth and very straight forward. Created by the guys that developed NEXT.JS, I have to say probably the best deployment UX out there right now.
